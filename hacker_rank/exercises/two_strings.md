Given two strings, determine if they share a common substring. A substring may be as small as one character.

Examples:

s1 = "and"

s2 = "art"

These share the common substring a.

s1 = "be"

s2 = "cat"

These do not share a substring.

Function Description: Complete the function twoStrings.

twoStrings has the following parameter(s): string s1: a string, string s2: another string.

Returns string: either "YES" or "NO".

Input Format: The first line contains a single integer p, the number of test cases. The following p pairs of lines are as follows: The first line contains string s1. The second line contains string s2.

Constraints:

s1 and s2 consist of characters in the range ascii[a-z]

1 <= p <= 10

1 <= |s1||s2| <= 10⁵

Output Format: For each pair of strings, return "YES" or "NO".

Sample Input: 2, "hello", "world"

Sample Output: "YES"

Sample Input: 2, "hi", "world"
