You'll have to simulate the video game's character selection screen behaviour, more specifically the selection grid.

Selection grid layout in text:

| Ryu | E.Honda | Blanka | Guile | Balrog | Vega |
| Ken | Chun Li | Zangief | Dhalsim | Sagat | M.Bison |

Input:

The list of game characters in a 2x6 grid. The initial position of the selection cursor (top-left is (0,0)). A list of moves of the selection cursor (which are up, down, left, right).

Output:

The list of characters who have been hovered by the selection cursor after all the moves (ordered and with repetition, all the ones after a move, weather successful or not, see tests).

Rules:

Selection cursor is circular horizontally but not vertically! As you might remember from the game, the selection cursor rotates horizontally but not vertically; that means that if I'm in the leftmost, and I try to go left again I'll get to the rightmost (examples: from Ryu to Vega, from Ken to M.Bison) and vice versa from rightmost to leftmost. Instead, if I try to go further up from the upmost or further down from the downmost, I'll just stay where I am located (examples: you can't go lower than lowest row: Ken, Chun Li, Zangief, Dhalsim, Sagat and M.Bison in the above image. You can't go upper than highest row: Ryu, E.Honda, Blanka, Guile, Balrog and Vega in the above image).

Test:

For this easy version the fighters grid layout and the initial position will always be the same in all tests, only the list of moves change. Notice: changing some of the input data might not help you.

Examples:

fighters = [
    ["Ryu", "E.Honda", "Blanka", "Guile", "Balrog", "Vega"],
    ["Ken", "Chun Li", "Zangief", "Dhalsim", "Sagat", "M.Bison"]
    ]
initial_position = (0,0)
moves = ['up', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'left']

Result: ['Ryu', 'Vega', 'Ryu', 'Vega', 'Balrog']

The characters I've been hovering over with the selection cursor during my moves. Notice: Ryu is the first just because it "fails" the first up. See test cases for more examples.

fighters = [
    ["Ryu", "E.Honda", "Blanka", "Guile", "Balrog", "Vega"],
    ["Ken", "Chun Li", "Zangief", "Dhalsim", "Sagat", "M.Bison"]
    ]
    initial_position = (0,0)
    moves = ['right', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'right']

Result: ['E.Honda', 'Chun Li', 'Ken', 'M.Bison', 'Sagat', 'Dhalsim', 'Sagat']
